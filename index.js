  EXAMPLE TASK:
    - Write an Airplane constructor that initializes `name` from an argument.

    - Give airplanes the ability to `.takeOff()` and `.land()`:
        + If a plane takes off, its `isFlying` property is set to true.
        + If a plane lands, its `isFlying` property is set to false.

  TASK 1
    - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
    - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

/* 
  TASK 4
  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  1. Window/global binding refers to either the window or console object, depending on what the script is being run on. In a browser console, it would be window; otherwise global.
  2. Implicit binding is the most commom principle used and it is when a function is called using a dot before it(like person.run()).
  3. New binding is used whenever you use a constructor function, referring to the specific instance of the object being created.
  4. Explicit binding is used whenever the call or apply function is used by a child prototype.
